sway-output(5)

# 名前

sway-output - sway の出力設定コマンド

# 説明

以下のようにコマンドを一つの行へまとめることができます。

	output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080 pos 1920 0 bg ~/wallpaper.png stretch

アウトプット名は *swaymsg -t get_outputs* で取得できます。すべてのアウトプットに該当させ
るために "\*" も使用可能です。 また、 "-" で名前指定、 "--"で識別子指定が可能です。

いくつかのアウトプットは、再接続すると名前が変わります。これらを判別するには、名前の代わりに
*swaymsg -t get_outputs* で取得できるモデル番号とシリアル番号を名前として代用できます。
それぞれの値は空白区切りです。例えば以下のようになります。

	output "Some Company ABC123 0x00000000" pos 1920 0

# コマンド

*output* <name> mode|resolution|res [--custom] <WIDTHxHEIGHT>[@<RATE>Hz]
	Configures the specified output to use the given mode. Modes are a
	combination of width and height (in pixels) and a refresh rate that your
	display can be configured to use. For a list of available modes for each
	output, use *swaymsg -t get_outputs*.

	To set a custom mode not listed in the list of available modes, use
	*--custom*. You should probably only use this if you know what you're
	doing.

	Examples:

		output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080

		output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080@60Hz

*output* <name> position|pos <X> <Y>
	Places the specified output at the specific position in the global
	coordinate space. The cursor may only be moved between immediately
	adjacent outputs. If scaling is active, it has to be considered when
	positioning. For example, if the scaling factor for the left output is
	2, the relative position for the right output has to be divided by 2.
	The reference point is the top left corner so if you want the bottoms
	aligned this has to be considered as well.

	Example:

		output HDMI1 scale 2

		output HDMI1 pos 0 1020 res 3200x1800

		output eDP1 pos 1600 0 res 1920x1080

	Note that the left x-pos of eDP1 is 1600 = 3200/2 and the bottom y-pos is
	1020 + (1800 / 2) = 1920 = 0 + 1920

*output* <name> scale <factor>
	Scales the specified output by the specified scale _factor_. An integer is
	recommended, but fractional values are also supported. If a fractional
	value are specified, be warned that it is not possible to faithfully
	represent the contents of your windows - they will be rendered at the next
	highest integer scale factor and downscaled. You may be better served by
	setting an integer scale factor and adjusting the font size of your
	applications to taste. HiDPI isn't supported with Xwayland clients (windows
	will blur).

*output* <name> scale_filter linear|nearest|smart
	Indicates how to scale application buffers that are rendered at a scale
	lower than the output's configured scale, such as lo-dpi applications on
	hi-dpi screens. Linear is smoother and blurrier, nearest (also known as
	nearest neighbor) is sharper and blockier. Setting "smart" will apply
	nearest scaling when the output has an integer scale factor, otherwise
	linear. The default is "smart".

*output* <name> subpixel rgb|bgr|vrgb|vbgr|none
	Manually sets the subpixel hinting for the specified output. This value is
	usually auto-detected, but some displays may misreport their subpixel
	geometry. Using the correct subpixel hinting allows for sharper text.
	Incorrect values will result in blurrier text. When changing this via
	*swaymsg*, some applications may need to be restarted to use the new value.

*output* <name> background|bg <file> <mode> [<fallback_color>]
	Sets the wallpaper for the given output to the specified file, using the
	given scaling mode (one of "stretch", "fill", "fit", "center", "tile"). If
	the specified file cannot be accessed or if the image does fill the entire
	output, a fallback color may be provided to cover the rest of the output.
	_fallback_color_ should be specified as _#RRGGBB_. Alpha is not supported.

*output* <name> background|bg <color> solid_color
	Sets the background of the given output to the specified color. _color_
	should be specified as _#RRGGBB_. Alpha is not supported.

*output* <name> transform <transform> [clockwise|anticlockwise]
	Sets the background transform to the given value. Can be one of "90", "180",
	"270" for rotation; or "flipped", "flipped-90", "flipped-180", "flipped-270"
	to apply a rotation and flip, or "normal" to apply no transform. The
	rotation is performed clockwise. If a single output is chosen and a
	rotation direction is specified (_clockwise_ or _anticlockwise_) then the
	transform is added or subtracted from the current transform.

*output* <name> disable|enable
	Enables or disables the specified output (all outputs are enabled by
	default).

*output* <name> toggle
	Toggle the specified output.

*output* <name> dpms on|off
	Enables or disables the specified output via DPMS. To turn an output off
	(ie. blank the screen but keep workspaces as-is), one can set DPMS to off.

*output* <name> max_render_time off|<msec>
	When set to a positive number of milliseconds, enables delaying output
	rendering to reduce latency. The rendering is delayed in such a way as
	to leave the specified number of milliseconds before the next
	presentation for rendering.

	The output rendering normally takes place immediately after a
	presentation (vblank, buffer flip, etc.) and the frame callbacks are
	sent to surfaces immediately after the rendering to give surfaces the
	most time to draw their next frame. This results in slightly below 2
	frames of latency between the surface rendering and committing new
	contents, and the contents being shown on screen, on average. When the
	output rendering is delayed, the frame callbacks are sent immediately
	after presentation, and the surfaces have a small timespan (1 /
	(refresh rate) - max_render_time) to render and commit new contents to
	be shown on the next presentation, resulting in below 1 frame of
	latency.

	To set this up for optimal latency:
	. Launch some _full-screen_ application that renders continuously, like
	  *glxgears*.
	. Start with *max_render_time 1*. Increment by *1* if you see frame
	  drops.

	To achieve even lower latency, see the *max_render_time* surface
	property in *sway*(5).

	Note that this property has an effect only on backends which report the
	presentation timestamp and the predicted output refresh rate—the DRM
	and the Wayland backends. Furthermore, under the Wayland backend the
	optimal max_render_time value may vary based on the parent compositor
	rendering timings.

*output* <name> adaptive_sync on|off
	Enables or disables adaptive synchronization (often referred to as Variable
	Refresh Rate, or by the vendor-specific names FreeSync/G-Sync).

	Adaptive sync allows clients to submit frames a little to late without
	having to wait a whole refresh period to display it on screen. Enabling
	adaptive sync can improve latency, but can cause flickering on some
	hardware.
